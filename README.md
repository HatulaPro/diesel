# diesel
A set of tools for programmers for creating simple DSLs (or rather, macros, but that's less cool). It has one goal: working seemlessly. Magic.

## Plans

Diesel hopes to support the TypeScript LSP, major IDEs, bundlers, etc. 

- [ ] Working Macros
  - [ ] Vite support
  - [ ] Webpack support
- [ ] Syntax Highlighting 
  - [ ] VS Code extension
  - [ ] Neovim extension
- [ ] LSP support (TypeScript autocomplete)
